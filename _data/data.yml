  title: About Me # NO MODIFICAR
  summary: >
    I am a computer systems engineer with 4 years of experience in website
    development mostly from the hotel marketing industry.  Half of my experience
    is developing websites with wordpress and the other half maintaining and
    developing pages for hotels with the Ruby on Rails Framework. Currently I
    live in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico and  I like cooking a lot because I find it
    very relaxing. I also go to the gym regularly. I like to swim and go out on
    weekends to explore hidden places in the mountains.I like the discipline,
    and my greatest quality is that I am very persistent.

    company: 'Villagroup'
    details: >
      My position was as a ruby on rails web developer. My experience working
      for the 
      Villagroup hotel chain in Puerto Vallarta has consisted in the
      administration and deployment
      of websites for hotels that are developed in Ruby on Rails. I am part of a
      small hotel 
      marketing team in Puerto Vallarta and as new needs arise related to the
      website,
      adjustments, redesigns and additions, I must make sure that these
      applications are in
      production using Amazon Web Services( EC2, S3, Route 53).
      I have also had to consume APIs that are specially designed to feed the
      room 
      rates for the hotels that I am responsible for. Here I have also been
      fullstack
      the infrastructure in Amazon. These are some of the activities I do.
        - Redesign and development of new websites for hotels with react and rails
        - UX enhancement design
        - Data analysis for site improvement
        - SEO Technical Performance analysis
        - Database Administration on MySql and PostgresSQL
        - Deployments on EC2 Amazon with Nginx and Passenger or Heroku
        - AB Testing

  - role: PHP Fullstack Web Developer
    time: 2017 - 2019
    company: 'OH Travel Marketing, Puerto Vallarta'
    details: >
      I worked for oh marketing for 2 years where I was a web developer, 
      initially doing several projects focused on the tourism sector, mainly for
      the design, development and deployment of hotel websites, convention
      centers 
      and the tourist destination of Puerto Vallarta.
      My functions were as a full stack web developer since while we developed
      the entire process of the creation of the websites using php for
      wordpress, we
      also had to implement everything necessary in the server infrastructure
      where these sites should be hosted through the aws services of amazon.
      Mostly my experience was developing websites with wordpress but there
      was a project on we worked for a big hotel reservations chain in the
      Caribbean
      in which we made the website using Laravel.
